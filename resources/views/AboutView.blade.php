            It is this premise that OFW Serbisyo't Kooperatiba shall make itself readily available to extend and lend a helping hand to OFWs and their family members who are in need of assistance; it will coordinate, communicate and serve as bridge or intermediary with concerned officials and personnel of agencies and offices of Philippine government to make sure that OFWs and family members' interests, rights and welfare are surely promoted, completely protected and sustainably safeguarded.
